<p style=text-align: right;>An upcoming regiscout that aims to perfectly mix the fields of regiments and scouts together without losing any operational value, as well as a personal mission to unite our community and create a brighter future for all!</p>

We are the Sangō Military Academy of Music, an ambitious military idol project made by a community veteran and uniform maker with experience in all areas!
<br>A customized, complex place, made to push the limits of what groups can do!
<br>A place that gives both the functional strictness of regiments and the creative freedom of scouts!

Please support us! We hope to release very soon!<br>
